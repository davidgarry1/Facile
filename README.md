I chose to implement the following code:
PRINT A
PRINTALL
.

to output:
0
A 0

**COMPLILING INSTRUCTIONS:**

For part 1: There is nothing to compile - the jpg image is titled "Part1"

For part 3: Naviate to the Part3 folder and type "make". Then "./msorttest" will run the test code for mergesort.

For part 4: Navigate to the Part4 folder and type "qmake -project", then "qmake", then "make". Then "./Part4" to run the graphical debugger. You will then be prompted for the input file name.
